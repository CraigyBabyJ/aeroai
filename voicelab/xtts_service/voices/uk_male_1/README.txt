Place a reference clip named ref.wav in this folder to drive XTTS speaker conditioning.

Guidelines:
- Mono WAV at 16 kHz or 22.05 kHz works well for most XTTS pipelines.
- Keep the sample clean (no music or heavy noise) and around 6-12 seconds.
- Update meta.json if you change the intended language, role, or description.
